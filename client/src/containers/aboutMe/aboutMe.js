        A North Carolina native, I got my Bachelor's degree in English from UNC
        Greensboro. Most of my professional career has been working in food
        service but I've also has the opportunity to write for a local newspaper
        and for a local news station. During the early days of the Covid
        pandemic, the company I worked for did mass layoffs and I found myself
        without a job. I decided to take that as an opportunity for a career
        change and decided to go down the path of becoming a full-stack
        developer.
